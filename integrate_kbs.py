\\section{{Introduction}}
\\label{{sec:introduction}}

Deep neural networks have revolutionized medical imaging analysis, achieving unprecedented diagnostic accuracy across various conditions~\\cite{{Mamo24}}. While these systems approach or exceed human-level performance in specialized tasks, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks; imperceptible perturbations that cause incorrect predictions with potentially serious clinical consequences~\\cite{{Bortsova21, Kaviani22}}.

Current defense strategies fall into several areas, which can be categorically grouped into three: (1) input preprocessing techniques (denoising~\\cite{{Chiang20}}, JPEG compression~\\cite{{Cheng21}}) that neutralize perturbations; (2) model regularization approaches like adversarial training~\\cite{{Muoka23}} that improve robustness; and (3) architectural modifications (defensive distillation~\\cite{{Qi24}}, feature squeezing~\\cite{{vasan2024}}, ensemble methods~\\cite{{Alzubaidi24}}) that detect or mitigate adversarial inputs. The success of these methods is, however, constrained by the particular difficulties associated with medical imaging.

{clean_ieee_refs(three_challenges)}

To tackle adversarial vulnerabilities in medical imaging, we propose MedDef, a framework built around a Defense-Aware Attention Mechanism (DAAM) that integrates defense directly into feature processing. DAAM comprises three components: Adversarial Feature Detection (AFD), which suppresses high-frequency adversarial noise while preserving fine-grained diagnostic features; Medical Feature Extraction (MFE), which enhances edge and texture cues using domain knowledge; and Multi-Scale Feature Analysis (MSF), which defends across spatial resolutions to maintain robust hierarchical representations.
