\section*{Highlights}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Novel Defense-Aware Attention Mechanism (DAAM) integrates adversarial robustness into feature extraction
    \item Medical domain-aware defensive strategy preserves diagnostic features while suppressing attacks
    \item Unstructured pruning enhances security rather than compromising it in medical imaging
    \item Achieves 97.52\% adversarial accuracy with maintained diagnostic performance
    \item Comprehensive evaluation on Retinal OCT and Chest X-Ray datasets against multiple attacks
\end{itemize}
