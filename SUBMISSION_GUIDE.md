What are the requirements for double-anonymized peer review?
Last updated on October 25, 2024
When a journal uses double-anonymized review it means that the author identities are concealed from the reviewers, and vice versa, throughout the review process.

To facilitate this, authors need to ensure that their manuscripts are prepared in a way that does not give away their identity. To help with this preparation, check the sections below for how to prepare your manuscript.

Submit the Title Page containing the Authors‚Äô details and the Anonymized Manuscript with no author details as two separate files.

Show all

Hide all

Title Page
This should include the title, all authors' names and affiliations, and a complete address for the corresponding author including telephone and e-mail address. Check the journal's Guide for Authors for any additional requirements.

Anonymized Manuscript
Besides the obvious need to remove names and affiliations under the title within the manuscript, there are other steps that need to be taken to ensure the manuscript is correctly prepared for double-anonymized peer review. To assist with this process the key items that need to be observed are as follows:

Use the third person to refer to work the Authors have previously undertaken, e.g. replace any phrases like ‚Äúas we have shown before‚Äù with ‚Äú‚Ä¶ has been shown before [Anonymous, 2007]‚Äù.
Make sure figures do not contain any affiliation related identifier.
Do not eliminate essential self-references or other references but limit self-references only to papers that are relevant for those reviewing the submitted paper.
Cite papers published by the Author in the text as: ‚Äò[Anonymous, 2007]‚Äô.
For anonymizing in the reference list: ‚Äò[Anonymous 2007] Details omitted for double-anonymized reviewing.‚Äô
Remove references to funding sources.
Do not include acknowledgments.
Remove any identifying information, including author names, from file names and ensure document properties are also anonymized.
